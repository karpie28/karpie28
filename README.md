# Hey, I'm Karol

I build tools that help defenders stay ahead of emerging AI threats. Lead DevSecOps engineer by day, open-source security tooling builder by night.

## What I'm working on

**[ClawTrap](https://github.com/karpie28/clawtrap)** — A honeypot that mimics an AI assistant to capture LLM-specific attack vectors: prompt injection, jailbreaks, and tool abuse. Built with TypeScript and deployed on Fargate.

**[Sundew](https://github.com/sundew-sh/sundew)** — Building in the open with the sundew-sh org. More coming soon.

## Speaking

- **[sudo grant me admin](https://www.meetup.com/southern-california-genai-meetup/events/312272415/)** ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xx5yBgy7sUCyDmXCAqQhzc2gZi5B9shKWlagTa0C41s/edit?usp=sharing)) — SoCal GenAI Meetup. Four real-world breaches covering supply chain attacks, infrastructure poisoning, and second-order prompt injections. Introduces Zero Trust protocols for AI agents.
- **[Red Teaming the Robot: Practical Open Source Security for LLMs](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/23x/presentations/red-teaming-robot-practical-open-source-security-llms)** — SCaLE 23x. Covers prompt injection, jailbreaking, model supply chain attacks, and hands-on defense with open-source tools like Garak and PyRIT.
