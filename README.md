# Hey, I'm Karol

I build tools that help defenders stay ahead of emerging AI threats. Lead DevSecOps engineer by day, open-source security tooling builder by night.

## What I'm working on

**[ClawTrap](https://github.com/karpie28/clawtrap)** — A honeypot that mimics an AI assistant to capture LLM-specific attack vectors: prompt injection, jailbreaks, and tool abuse. Built with TypeScript and deployed on Fargate.

**[Sundew](https://github.com/sundew-sh/sundew)** — Building in the open with the sundew-sh org. More coming soon.

Based in Costa Mesa, CA. Open to collaboration on AI security tooling and defensive research.
